This is  an API helper for working with the Common Data Service (CDS) and Dynamics 365 Web API

Design goals include
 - Lightweight 
 - Simple API signatures as similar as possible across languages
 - Integrate well with Azure Active Directory / Authentication libraries but don't bake them in
 - JavaScript library to work from web resource or external application 


There are versions of the API for .NET, JavaScript, Node, Python and PHP with Java coming soon

Feedback and contributions welcome...if you are going to propose major changes open an issue first to discuss the change.
